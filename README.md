# coupled-relativity
A study on coupling of relativistic particles with Python.

The idea is to use relativistic ideas such as conservation of four-momentum with wave dynamics such as coupling.  

## Installation
To install the package, use pip and run:

'pip install --user git+https://github.com/dougmurray/coupled-relativity'

## The FourMomentum Class
This is based on Igor Babuschkin's (ibab) excellent definition provided by his missing_hep package.
